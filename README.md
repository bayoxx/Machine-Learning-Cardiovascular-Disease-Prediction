## Regression: Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

## Project Introduction
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, making early detection and prevention critical in healthcare. With the increasing availability of health data, machine learning techniques have emerged as powerful tools for predicting health risks, including the likelihood of developing cardiovascular diseases. This project leverages a logistic regression model to predict the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in patients based on various demographic and clinical factors. This project aims to enhance early diagnosis, inform treatment strategies, and ultimately contribute to improved patient outcomes by harnessing the power of predictive analytics.

## Project Description
The Cardiovascular Disease Prediction project focuses on developing a predictive model to assess the risk of coronary heart disease using a dataset that includes demographic factors, medical history, and behavioural attributes of patients. The project involves the following key steps:

- Data Collection: A comprehensive dataset comprising relevant features associated with cardiovascular health was gathered. This dataset was subjected to initial exploratory data analysis to identify trends, patterns, and potential anomalies.

- Data Preprocessing: To address the challenges of class imbalance inherent in the dataset, techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) were employed. This ensured a balanced representation of patients with and without CHD for model training.

- Model Development: A logistic regression model was developed to predict the 10-year risk of CHD. The model's performance was evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC score, with a particular focus on optimizing the decision threshold for better predictive performance.

- Evaluation and Optimization: An optimal threshold for classification was determined to enhance the model's predictive ability. Various performance metrics were analyzed to ensure that the model meets the clinical needs for accurate prediction while minimizing false negatives and false positives.

- Insights and Recommendations: The results were interpreted to provide insights into the model's performance, and recommendations were made for future enhancements and clinical applications.
